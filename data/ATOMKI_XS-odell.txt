# abstract = {The astrophysically important He3(α,γ)Be7 reaction was studied at high energies where the available experimental data are in contradiction. A thin window 3He gas cell was used and the cross section was measured with the activation method. The obtained cross sections at energies between Ec.m.=1.5 and 2.5 MeV are compared with the available data and theoretical calculations. The present results support the validity of the high energy cross section energy dependence observed by recent experiments.}
